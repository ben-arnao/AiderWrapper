# Aider Prompt UI

A small Tkinter-based interface for sending prompts to the [`aider`](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) CLI.

## Features
- Dropdown to select model quality: **High** (`gpt-5`), **Medium** (`gpt-5-mini`, default), or **Low** (`gpt-5-nano`).
- Model selector sits beneath the working directory chooser for a cleaner layout.
- Working directory chooser that shows the current path and remembers the last selection.
- Multiline text area for composing prompts.
- Startup check that validates the `OPENAI_API_KEY` via a test API call.
- Each request receives a unique identifier and is logged in a table that shows commit ids, total line and file changes, per-request cost, and any failure reason. The history view abbreviates IDs so the table remains compact.
- Failed runs record aider's exit code and last output line, or note when no output was captured, so troubleshooting is easier.
- History rows can be copied to the clipboard with **Ctrl+C** for easy sharing.
- The Send button has been removedâ€”press **Enter** to dispatch a prompt.
- A boxed status bar sits between the prompt area and the output, showing detailed status for each request and whether we're waiting on aider or the user. When more details are needed, it explicitly tells you to provide the requested files or answers.
- After a successful commit, the status bar offers a **Test changes** link that builds and launches your Unity project via the command line. Configure the Unity Editor path via `config.ini` (`[build] build_cmd`), the `UNITY_PATH` environment variable, or let the app auto-detect a Unity Hub installation.
  - A **Build & Run** button in the top-right corner uses the selected working directory as the Unity project path and invokes `RogueLike2D.Editor.BuildScript.PerformWindowsBuild` to compile and launch the game. The build step receives a custom output path and the launcher falls back to the first `.exe` in the build folder if the expected name is missing.
- Build failures, including missing game binaries, open a scrollable dialog showing Unity's log tail and stderr so long stack traces can be reviewed and copied without hunting for files.
- Draggable divider lets the prompt area take space from the response area when needed.
- Successful commits highlight the status bar message in green.
- After a successful commit, starting a new request clears prior output so separate conversations don't mix.
- Aider output is sanitized to remove ANSI color codes so messages display cleanly.
- Each request records its cost in dollars and the total session spend is shown in the main window.

## Development Best Practices

- Add tests for functionality changes to verify new behavior.
- Break up and modularize code where possible to reduce merge conflicts.
- Utility helpers live in focused modules (e.g., `utils.text`, `utils.config`)
  so changes stay scoped to their domain.
