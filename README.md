# Aider Prompt UI

A small Tkinter-based interface for sending prompts to the [`aider`](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) CLI.

## Features
- Dropdown to select model quality: **High** (`gpt-5`), **Medium** (`gpt-5-mini`, default), or **Low** (`gpt-5-nano`).
- Working directory chooser that shows the current path and remembers the last selection.
- Multiline text area for composing prompts.
- Draggable divider lets the prompt area take space from the response area when needed.
- Startup check that validates the `OPENAI_API_KEY` via a test API call.
- Timeout for detecting the commit ID is adjustable (default 5 minutes) via a gear-icon settings dialog.
- Each request receives a unique identifier and is logged in a table that shows commit ids, total line and file changes, and any failure reason.
- Timeout preference is saved to a small config file, but the model always defaults to **Medium** on startup.
- The Send button has been removedâ€”press **Enter** to dispatch a prompt.
- A boxed status bar sits between the prompt area and the output, reporting whether we're waiting on aider or the user.
- Successful commits highlight the status bar message in green.
- Output from previous requests remains visible so the full conversation can be reviewed.
